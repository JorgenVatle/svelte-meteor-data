# `svelte-meteor-data`

This package integrates the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) UI framework with
Meteor's Tracker system.  It makes it easy to write Svelte components which
react automatically to changes in Meteor's data layer.

This package is still experimental.  Use at your peril.

## Installation

To add Svelte to your Meteor app, run:

```bash
meteor add svelte:compiler rdb:svelte-meteor-data
meteor npm install --save svelte@3.31.2
```

## Usage

Unlike in Blaze, Svelte does not automatically become aware of changes to Meteor
state, even inside `$:` blocks.  This package provides some features that enable
Svelte to become aware of such changes.

### Reactive computations with `useTracker`

The `useTracker()` function can be used to expose any reactive computation as a
Svelte store.  You need only pass a callable returning a computed value, which
will be run the first time it is used and then every time the computed value
changes.  The updated value is automatically made available to Svelte.

For example, this example makes the current Meteor user available in a
component, and causes Svelte to update the appropriate element automatically
when the current user changes:

```svelte
<script>
  import { useTracker } from 'meteor/rdb:svelte-meteor-data';

  const currentUser = useTracker(() => Meteor.user());
</script>

<h1>Welcome {$currentUser.username}!</h1>
```

You can even mix Meteor reactivity with Svelte reactivity:

```svelte
<script>
  import { useTracker } from 'meteor/rdb:svelte-meteor-data';

  let selectedUserId;

  $: selectedUser = useTracker(() => Meteor.users.findOne(selectedUserId));
</script>

<p>Selected {$selectedUser.username}</p>
```

### Cursors

While it's possible to use queries with `useTracker(() => query.fetch())`, this
package supports a more convenient way to handle reactive queries, by allowing
you to use a MongoDB cursor directly as a Svelte store:

```svelte
<script>
  export let fruitColor = 'blue';

  $: fruits = Fruits.find({color: fruitColor});
</script>

<p>Showing {$fruits.length} {fruitColor}-colored fruits:</p>
<ul>
  {#each $fruits as fruit}
    <li>{fruit.name}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

### Subscriptions

You can safely use `Meteor.subscribe` in your components without worrying about
clean-up.  The subscription will be stopped automatically when the component is
destroyed.

As an added feature, you can use a subscription handle in an `{#await}` block:

```svelte
{#await Meteor.subscribe('todos')}
  <p>Loading todosâ€¦</p>
{:then}
  <TodoList />
{/await}
```

### Tracker.autorun

It is possible to use `Tracker.autorun()` with a function that is automatically
re-run when its Meteor dependencies change.  It will stop being updated when the
component is destroyed.  This will work fine for top-level computations that do
not depend on any dynamic Svelte state, such as in this example:

```svelte
<script>
  let currentUser;

  Tracker.autorun(() => {
    currentUser = Meteor.user();
  });
</script>
```

To make the autorun also respond to Svelte state changes, you need to put it
under a `$:` block.  This will work, but with some caveats: if the Tracker state
is invalidated right after a change to the Svelte state, all `$:` blocks will be
re-run.  It is therefore better to use `useTracker` instead, as listed above.

### ReactiveVar

A Meteor ReactiveVar will work seamlessly as a Svelte store, and can be accessed
and bound like any writable store using the `$` operator:

```svelte
<script>
  import { ReactiveVar } from 'meteor/reactive-var';

  const store = new ReactiveVar("initial");
</script>

<input type="text" bind:value={$store} />

<p>Value is {$store}</p>
```

### Session variables

If you are using Meteor [Session](https://docs.meteor.com/api/session.html)
variables, these can be exposed as a reactive Svelte store using the
`useSession` hook.  The first argument is the session key to expose, and the
optional second argument allows you to set a default value for the session
variable, as an added convenience.

This function is only available if the `session` package has been added.

```svelte
<script>
  import { useSession } from 'meteor/rdb:svelte-meteor-data';

  const store = useSession('mySessionKey', 'initial');

  // The above is equivalent to:
  //Session.setDefault('mySessionKey', 'initial')
  //const store = useSession('mySessionKey');
</script>

<input type="text" bind:value={$store} />

<p>Value is {$store}</p>
```
